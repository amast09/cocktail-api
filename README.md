## Mixologist

Mono repository for [mixologist.app](https://mixologist.app) (coming soon).

The genesis for this application was scratching my own itch.

I thought it would be cool to understand different cocktails I could
possibly make based on the ingredients I had lying around.

The other goal of this app was to gain some experience with some Scala libraries
(http4s, cats, cats-effect, circe, etc...) and at the same time I always wanted
to learn Elm so I built the frontend using Elm.
